                        As a kid, I expressed my artistry in original and creative ways. My dad always used to take me to the children's museum and I remember always going to the Play-Doh. I was always called <span className="text-yellow-400 underline">"smart"</span>, <span className="text-yellow-400 underline">"bright"</span>, and <span className="text-yellow-400 underline">"clever"</span> but I never liked those names.

                        I figured it out. I think the word that best describes me is <span className="text-green-400 underline"><em>resourceful</em></span>. It's an inate human trait which means I have it, but it doesn't manifest in everyone.

                        When I was in 8th grade, I had the incredible opportunity of going to National Science Bowl Finals, one which I never crossed paths with again. Of course, I didn't know this, and I <span className="text-blue-400 underline">regret</span> not spending my time enjoying the experience to the fullest.

                        I recently understood that <span className="text-blue-400">I acquired most of my knowledge from talking to teachers and subject experts and watching documentaries. I learned to lucid dream which helped me remember the tiny details in in a imagery-filled world. Those were always the interesting parts of my day.</span> It was in 8th grade where I learned how I learned. I've since applied this everywhere.

                        To me, resourcefulness doesn't mean I'm able to handle difficult situations well. To me, it means in difficult situations, I'm able to find new solutions. Abstract thoughts every night bring me those solutions. Nature and earthly design processes parallel those thoughts and in turn create <span className="text-pink-400 underline">new</span>, <span className="text-pink-400 underline">beautiful</span>, and <span className="text-pink-400 underline">minimal</span> creations that can inspire.

                        Those creations are what my brain thinks about every little while now and then. I focus on what I think matters. I'm a software developer and designer now. <span className="text-pink-400">Those moments with Play-Doh and the abstract thoughts at night quietly metamorphosed into who I am today. Whimsical thoughts and fantastical dreams characterize how I think about topics from the maths and sciences to the creative arts and social studies. I notice the sounds around me and it inspires me to create and motivates me to finish. Ambience is the best noise for creation in my opinion and creation is what fuels thought and produces knowledge.</span>

                    <p className="story">
                        As I mold the Play-Doh of my memories into grand, conceptual ideas and thoughts, I think about what I've done to get to the point I'm at, and what I can do to become better. Whether that be the obvious or the opinionated, I strive to become more <span className="text-pink-400 underline">inventive</span> and <span className="text-pink-400 underline">resourceful</span> on my journey throughout life. I've learned that to be heard, you must make some noise, and so starts the bang. My life is my own and the future is up to us. So go think, dream, and create. Express yourself like you've never before.
